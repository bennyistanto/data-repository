# Data Repository

Data and information play an important role in decision making. Furthermore I specifically talk about the geographical data related to place and position on the earth. In spite of the limited availability of geographical data in the internet, this data is considerably important for visualisation, planning and decision support system in all administrative level including local, regional, national and global. 

The data are categorized into Boundaries (bnd), Climate (cli), Hydrographic (hyd), Natural Hazards (nhr), Physical (phy), Point of Interests (poi), Settlements (pop), Transportation (trs) and Utilities (uti).

Vector data comes in GeoJSON and ESRI shapefile format, raster data comes in TIFF format  and sometimes with a TFW world file. All data use the Geographic coordinate system (projection) [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326), WGS84 datum `+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs`. Some data also used Projected coordinate system [EPSG:900913](https://epsg.io/900913) Google Mercator `+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext +over +no_defs`.

I provide all the data as a public service and are not responsible for any problems relating to accuracy, content, design, and how it is used. If you find an error or omission, please report it for future updates.
